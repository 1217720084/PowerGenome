Power system optimization models can be used to explore the cost and emission implications of different regulations in future energy systems. One of the most difficult parts of running these models is assembling all the data. A typical model will define several regions, each of which need data such as:

- All existing generating units (perhaps grouped into a few discrete clusters within each region)
- Transmission constraints between regions
- Hourly load profiles (including new loads from vehicle and building electrification)
- Hourly generation profiles for wind & solar
- Cost estimates for new generating units

Because computational complexity and run times increase as the number of regions and generating unit clusters increases, a user might want only want to disaggregate regions and generating units close to the primary region of interest. For example, a study focused on clean electricity regulations in New Mexico might combine several states in the Pacific Northwest into a single region while also splitting Arizona combined cycle units into multiple clusters.

The goal of PowerGenome is to let a user make all of these choices in a settings file and then run a single script that generates input files for the power system model. PowerGenome currently generates input files for [GenX](https://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Enhanced-Decision-Support-for-a-Changing-Electricity-Landscape.pdf), and we hope to expand to other models in the near future.

## PUDL Dependency

This project pulls data from [PUDL](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl). As such, it requires installation of PUDL to access a normalized sqlite database and some of the convienience PUDL functions.

`catalystcoop.pudl` is included in the `environment.yml` file and will be installed automatically in the conda environment (see instructions below). The data used by PowerGenome have outstripped what is available in the public version of PULD, so download a modifed version of the [PUDL sqlite database here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18tLKbok1-me81SkfWAhSLXmy5HW6RdvI).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the top level (PowerGenome) folder.

2. Create a conda environment named `powergenome` using the provided `environment.yml` file.

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

3. Activate the `powergenome` environment.

```sh
conda activate powergenome
```

4. pip-install an editable version of this project

```sh
pip install -e .
```

5. Download a [modifed version of the PULD database](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18tLKbok1-me81SkfWAhSLXmy5HW6RdvI) that includes NREL ATB cost data and is not yet included in PUDL. ~~Build the local database following [PUDL instructions](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#getting-started). Skip the first step of creating the pudl conda environment since you have already installed pudl in the powergenome environment. I recommend modifying the example `pudl_data` line as follows:~~

```sh
pudl_data --sources eia923 eia860 ferc1 epaipm --years 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017
```

6. ~~Be sure to edit the `etl_example.yml` file to include all years of 860/923 data. Remove all years from `epacems`.~~

7. Once you have downloaded ~~created~~ the sqlite database, change the `SETTINGS["pudl_db"]` parameter in `powergenome/params.py` to match the path on your computer.

8. Get an [API key for EIA's OpenData portal](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php). This key is needed to download projected fuel prices from the 2019 Annual Energy Outlook. Create the file `PowerGenome/powergenome/.env` and save the key in this file using the format `EIA_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`. No quotation marks are needed around the API string. The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and will not be synced with the repository.


## Running code

Settings are controlled in a YAML file. The default is `pudl_data_extraction.yml`.

The code is currently structured in three main modules - `generators.py`, `transmission.py`, and `load_profiles.py`. Functions from each can be imported and used in an interactive environment (e.g. JupyterLab). To run from the command line, activate the  `pudl` conda environment, navigate to the `powergenome` folder, and run

```sh
python extract_pudl_data.py
```

There are currently 3 arguments that can be used after the script name:

- -sf (--settings_file), the name of an alternative settings YAML file.
- -rf (--results_folder), the name of a results subfolder to save files in. If no subfolder is specified the default is to create one named for the current datetime.
- -a (--all_units), if information on all units should be saved in a separate CSV file. The default value is `True`.

An example using all three options would be:

```sh
python extract_pudl_data.py -sf pudl_data_extraction_CA_present.yml -rf CA-present -a True
```

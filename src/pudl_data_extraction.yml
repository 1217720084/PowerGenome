# This file controls what data is extracted from PUDL and how it is processed.

# MODEL YEAR
# This is used to determine which plants are retired. Can also be used for changes
# in demand over time in the future.
model_year: 2030


# DATA YEAR
# Pick one or more years of generator data to use when creating clusters. If
# more than one year is used then things like heat rate will be calculated as the
# average (weighted by generation per year).

# REGIONS
# Select the regions and any regional aggregations that should be performed.
# This currenly only works for IPM regions, either as the regions used in GenX or as
# aggregations.

# Can also use this to rename regions used in the model by only including a single
# region in the associated aggretation list below.

# CLUSTERING
# Existing thermal power plants are clusted to reduce the number of distinct plants.
# The existing method (for now) is to specify the number of clusters for each type
# of thermal plant as a default and then specify specific values for any regions
# that are different.

# Technologies that aren't listed here won't be included in the final cluster
# outputs, even if they are included in alt_clusters below.

# DATA YEAR
# Pick one or more years of generator data to use when creating clusters. If
# more than one year is used then things like heat rate will be calculated as the
# average (weighted by generation per year).

# REGIONS
# Select the regions and any regional aggregations that should be performed.
# This currenly only works for IPM regions, either as the regions used in GenX or as
# aggregations.

# CLUSTERING
# Existing thermal power plants are clusted to reduce the number of distinct plants.
# The existing method (for now) is to specify the number of clusters for each type
# of thermal plant as a default and then specify specific values for any regions
# that are different.

num_clusters:
  Conventional Steam Coal: 1
  Natural Gas Fired Combined Cycle: 1
  Natural Gas Fired Combustion Turbine: 1
  Nuclear: 1
  Conventional Hydroelectric: 1
  Wood/Wood Waste Biomass: 1

# Add code to ensure region names here are included above
